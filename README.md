## Textbooks, Education, Lectures
[Quantum Country](https://quantum.country) An text on quantum computing, combined with a testing system which will attempt to fix the information as knowledge rather than lost in short-term memory. This is article was my entry-point into quantum computing.

[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=quantum+nielsen&qid=1578104389&s=books&sr=1-1) Not recommended, simply because it is a thorough college-level textbook. It is likely to be a waste of money and blunt your enthusiasm. The author is the same author of the simpler text above, so this book is proof that the Quantum Country text is a valid source. Presumably, if you really want to get deep into the subject, this would be a good source.

[Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) Written by the IBM team as an educational source for the qiskit library and SaaS product, the initial chapters on Quantum Computing concepts are well written.

[Q# Quantum Computing Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/concepts/?view=qsharp-preview) Microsoft's documentation on Q# and Quantum Computing Concepts. This link goes to the Concepts part of the documetation. Again, well written, and useful on re-explaining concepts that benefit from lots of different re-explanation. At time of publication, it was easy, from this page, to browse to all of the other Q# documentation.

## Books
Beyond Weird by Philip Ball ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Weird-Everything-Thought-Different/dp/022655838X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=beyond+weird&qid=1578099270&sr=8-1)) Recommended, but this book will not help anyone with quantum computing. Essentially, you can fully ignore the craziness of quantum theory, just focus on the math, and do quantum computing just fine. Most people going into this work are probably interested in quantum theory even if it isn't going to directly apply to their work. In that case, this is the book for you. It tackles quantum weirdnesses head-on and doesn't so much explain quantum mechanics as:
- Work through all of the popular metaphors and frameworks and detail how these fall short or obscure our understanding.
- Explain as much of the known quantum world as possible, while being clear about areas of uncertainty that we have to accept.

Some 5-minute marketting videos from IBM. These aren't going to help anyone work on quantum computing, but they are short, cool, and inspiring with lots of interesting factoids around IBM's quantum computing physical plant.
